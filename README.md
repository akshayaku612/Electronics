# List of Projects

## 1) WiFi Controlled DC Motor Car - C, Soldering, Hardware Debugging
Programmed a TI MSP430 MCU to drive brushed dc motors using PWM across the H-bridge, used ADC connected to a potentiometer to swap screens on a TFT LCD Display, used IOT(WiFi) to remotely control the car by sending commands from an Android Phone, and worked on a software solution for switch debouncing using timer and GPIO interrupts. Soldered PCBs and assembled the mechanical and electrical components of the car.

## 2) Test Stand Breakout Board - PCB Design and PCBA
PCB Design of a Breakout Board for the TI Hercules Microcontroller for Liquid Rocketry Lab's test stand

## 3) Digital Circuit Analysis - AD2
Analysing and testing different breadboard circuits using Analog Discovery 2
