# List of Projects

## 1) Binary Artificial Neural Network - Verilog and Synopsys
Designed a Verilog RTL module that implemented a fixed size single stage of a binary convolutional neural network by inputting the weight and input matrix from SRAMs and storing the computed result in an SRAM. Simulated in Modelsim and synthesised the project in Synopsys using SDC scripts and ensured timing constraints are met 

## 2) Bimodal and GShare Branch Predictor - C++
Created a branch predictor simulator for Bimodal and GShare Branch Predictors. Calculated the number of mispredictions and misprediction rates for different sizes and created a report analysing the results for different sizes.

## 3) CPU Design - Verilog
The microcontroller designed in this project is a simplified version of a CPU.

## 4) Public Key Encryption - Verilog
Implementing RSA Encryption

## 5) Low Pass Filter Model - COMSOL
Model and simulation of an Equal Ripple Microstrip Low-pass Filter
